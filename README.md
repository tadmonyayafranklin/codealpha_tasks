âœ… TASK 1: Basic Network Sniffer

- Build a Python program to capture network traffic packets.
- Analyze captured packets to understand their structure and content.
- Learn how data flows through the network and the basics of protocols.
- I have used `scapy` for packet capturing.
- Display useful information such as source/destination IPs, protocols and payloads.

Run the script in your terminal using `sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py`. You should see the captured packets with details like source/destination IPs, protocols, and part of the payload (if applicable).
